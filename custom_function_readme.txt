# Genetic Algorithm for Optimizing a Custom Function

## Overview
This example uses a genetic algorithm to optimize a custom function within a specified range.

## How to Use
- Open `index.html` in a web browser.
- Input your custom function and range.
- Click "Start Optimization" to see the genetic algorithm in action.

## Mechanism
The genetic algorithm optimizes the function using:
- **Selection**: Solutions with better function values have a higher chance of being selected.
- **Crossover**: Combines two solutions to produce a new solution.
- **Mutation**: There's a small chance of a random change in a solution to introduce variability.
